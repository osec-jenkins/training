generate sample Spring Boot project using https://start.spring.io/
create private GitHub repository and push there code generated in previous step
create job that pulls code from GitHub repository and prints git commit SHA (use environment variable found at https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Git+Plugin)
create downstream job that fails randomly (you can use the following script: exit `shuf -i 0-1 -n 1`)
create further downstream job that prints parameter value passed from it's upstream job
create view that shows only jobs created in this exercise (tip: create naming convention)
create delivery pipeline view that starts from the first job created in this exercise
question: what happens when we limit number of Jenkins executors to 1 and trigger the pipeline several times?
question: what happens if we set quiet period to 0?
start discarding builds for the first job created in this exercise if their number grows to more than 3
question: how does that change affect content of JENKINS_HOME/jobs directory?
make the last job created in this exercise print git commit SHA and git branch name passed from the first job instead of what it prints now
