clone git project from https://github.com/osec-jenkins/demoapp repository
build the project using maven
create new GitHub repository and push that project into created repository
create Jenkins job that polls this repository every 2 minutes and build the project using maven
change `private final` to `final private` in src/main/java/com/example/demoapp/ApplicationController.java and push that change to GitHub repository
let's assume that the above change is accepted convention in our project and make the job pass
publish junit test report as part of Jenkins job
install violations and jacoco plugins
publish jacoco coverage report as part of Jenkins job
publish checkstyle violations as part of Jenkins job
uncomment git-commit-id-plugin in pom.xml and push that change
check classes/git.properties file conent in job workspace
question: what does the conten of that file represents?
